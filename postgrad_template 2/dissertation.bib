% NOTE: the text included in the \noopsort command is hidden when the reference is displayed in the bibliography, but is used when alphabetising the references. In the examples below, there is an author listed both as "Samuel Kaski" and "S. Kaski", which would ordinarily be alphabetised as different authors. By modifying both entries (using noopsort) so that they both appear to be "Samuel. Kaski" (by changing S. Kaski to S{amuel}. Kaski, and Samuel Kaski to Samuel{.} Kaski - braces indicate the hidden portions in each, respectively) to the alphabetiser, they are alphabetised correctly, while appearing in the correct form (as they were published).
